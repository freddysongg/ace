Training 1:
- Loss was in 20,000 -> had to use scaler to normalize values
- Model was overfitting -> introduced two layers of Dropout to regularize 
- Model focusing on lower loss of NO2 so neglects PM2.5 and Ozone

Training 2: With Dropout and Scaler
- MSE at 0.23, MAE at 0.29
- PM2.5 and Ozone R2 increased
- Flaws in systematic bias and unexplained variance from the graphs
- Ozone & PM2.5 predictions have a systematic bias in them
- NO2 predictions are flat 

Training 3: With Feature Engineering using that USGS/DEM data
- Ozone R2 0.76 with RMSE 5.1
- PM2.5 and NO2 performance is still subpar -> possible information ceiling
- Need more information on extreme PM2.5 events (like wildfires, unique meteoroligcal events)
